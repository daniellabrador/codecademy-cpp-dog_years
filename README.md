# **Dog Years**

The Dog Years program will compute your dog's age in human years. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus), has been an invaluable exercise in applying the knowledge I learned in learning to declare variables using C++.

## Project Prompt

> "How old is your fuzzy friend in human years?"

Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. If you own a dog, you might’ve heard this rule: one year for Snoopy equals seven years for you. Turns out, the math isn’t that simple. Dogs mature more quickly than we do early on.

Here’s how we can convert your dog’s age into human years:

- The first two years of a dog’s life count as 21 human years.
- Each following year counts as 4 human years.

So a one-year-old dog is 10.5 years old in human years, and a two-year-old dog is 21 years old in human years… hmm this is about to get more complicated. Before you start doing the math in your head, let a computer take care of it!

Write a C++ program called `dog_years.cpp` to calculate the age, in human years, of any dog older than 2.

## Technologies

- C++

## Setup

Generally, you would want to compile and execute the program locally. To do that:

1. Download initials.cpp.
2. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the downloaded file resides.
3. Run the following commands to compile and execute the program:

```git
g++ dog_years.cpp -o dog_years
./dog_years
```
